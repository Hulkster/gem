Egypt traded for materials used for creating jewelry since 3000 BCE. Long-range trade routes first appeared when the Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. The Phoenicians - noted sea traders - traveled across the Mediterranean Sea, and as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. They established trade colonies the Greeks called emporia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Trade continued to drive the human tendency to explore long after the demise of the ancient Mediterranean maritime empires.

With the advent of these globe-spanning media types has also arisen the ability to reach the masses like never before, and not always in a good way. The attempt to bias or control large amounts of information, either through nefariously minded propaganda or more innocent personal opinions being injected into facts, is becoming a large problem for some governments and organizations to deal with.  Invasive advertising techniques are also a byproduct of mass media, much to the annoyance of consumers everywhere.
